## Information

This repository was cloned from the [nhs-england-tools/repository-template](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/repository-template.git)

### Prerequisites

The following software packages, or their equivalents, are expected to be installed and configured:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container runtime or a compatible tool, e.g. [Podman](https://podman.io/),
- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) version manager,
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 3.82 or later,
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Java version 17 or higher
- [gsed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) - for MacOS only

> [!NOTE]<br>
> The version of GNU make available by default on macOS is earlier than 3.82. You will need to upgrade it or certain `make` tasks will fail. On macOS, you will need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, then to install `make`, like so:
>
> ```shell
> brew install make
> ```
>
> You will then see instructions to fix your [`$PATH`](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_path.tmpl) variable to make the newly installed version available. If you are using [dotfiles](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles), this is all done for you.

- [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) and [GNU grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) are required for the scripted command-line output processing,
- [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) and [GNU binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) may be required to build dependencies like Python, which may need to be compiled during installation,

> [!NOTE]<br>
> For macOS users, installation of the GNU toolchain has been scripted and automated as part of the `dotfiles` project. Please see this [script](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles/blob/main/assets/20-install-base-packages.macos.sh) for details.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) required to run Git hooks,
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

### Configuration

Installation and configuration of the toolchain dependencies

```shell
make config
```

## Sandbox

There is a minimalist sandbox environment in `sandbox` with an accompanying [README](sandbox/README.md) with instructions on how to run it locally.

## Specification

The OpenAPI specification is stored in `specification`. In that folder, there is an accompanying [README](specification/README.md) with instructions on how to produce an environment-specific specification and publish
it using proxygen CLI.

## Deployment

The deployment workflows are defined in the `.github/workflows/` folder. There is an accompanying [README](.github/DEPLOYMENT_README.md) with details on how the deployment works and how to use it.

## Contributing
